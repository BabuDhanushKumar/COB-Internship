Data Science Internship Project

This repository contains the work completed during my data science internship. The project was conducted in two phases.

Phase 1: Data Collection and Cleaning

Task 1: API Data Collection and CSV Creation

In this phase, I utilized the Binance API to collect data and created a CSV dataset using Python and Pandas.

API Endpoint: https://data.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr

Generated CSV Dataset: Download Dataset

Task 2: Data Cleaning

I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring data quality.
