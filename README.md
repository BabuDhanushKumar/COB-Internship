**Data Science Internship Project**

This repository contains the work completed during my data science internship. The project was conducted in two phases.

**Phase 1: Data Collection and Cleaning**

**Task 1: API Data Collection and CSV Creation**

In this phase, I utilized the Binance API to collect data and created a CSV dataset using Python and Pandas.

API Endpoint: https://data.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr

Generated CSV Dataset: binance_data.csv

**Task 2: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring data quality.

**Timeline:**

Phase 1 Start Date: October 5, 2023

Phase 1 Deadline: October 20, 2023
