# COB-Internship
**Data Science Internship Project**

This repository contains the work completed during my data science internship. The project was conducted in two phases.

**Phase 1: Data Collection and Cleaning**

**Task 1: API Data Collection and CSV Creation**

In this phase, I utilized the Binance API to collect data and created a CSV dataset using Python and Pandas.

**API Endpoint:** https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/24hr

**Generated CSV Dataset:** binance_data.csv

**Task 2: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring data quality.

**Dataset Used:** dataset - netflix1.csv

**New Dataset Created :** cleaned_dataset_netflix1.csv

**Phase 2: Data Analysis and Modeling**

**Task 3: Data Analysis and Visualization**

In this phase, I analyzed the dataset and created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

**Dataset Used:** dataset - netflix1.csv

**Task 4: Simple Linear Regression Modeling**

I trained a simple linear regression model on the given training dataset and made predictions using the test dataset.

**Train Dataset:** train.csv

**Test Dataset:** test.csv


**Timeline:**

Phase 1 Start Date: October 5, 2023

Phase 1 Deadline: October 20, 2023

Phase 2 Start Date: October 21, 2023
